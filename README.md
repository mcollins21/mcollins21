### <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="30px"> Hey, I'm [Michael](https://github.com/mcollins21)!

Currently I'm studying Computer Science at Loyola University Chicago and I´m based in Chicago, Illinois.

Since 2019 I've been exploring the world of audio software, specifically VST3 plugins and Ableton Max for Live devices. :control_knobs:

### What I'm focusing on 👨‍💻

Currently leveling up my experience in java and assembly language! <br />
Outside out coding you can probably find me at the music studio or grabbing a cup of coffee! :coffee:
